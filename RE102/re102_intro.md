![alt text](https://nobarxtx.github.io/RE102/images/geometricintro.gif "geometricintro")

# In this workshop you will ... #

* Reverse Engineer **Real** Malware

* Understand how Delphi application binaries are structured

* Learn some evasion techniques (Anti-Re, Anti-Automation, Anti-VM)

* Learn how to identify an encryption algorithm

* Execute an assembly program using the Unicorn Engine

* Identify a custom packing technique


## Again, Analysis Flow for Malware Analysis ##

* Setup a baseline analysis environment

* Triage to determine a starting point

* Static Analysis - Get a sense of where everything is before debugging

* Dynamic Analysis - Determine behaviors that canâ€™t be understood by static analysis

* Manual Debugging - Stepping through the program to navigate to your goals
