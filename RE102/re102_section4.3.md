# Section 4.3: Convert the Shellcode Into an Exe #

Now you have the decrypted shellcode. This section will go over converting the shellcode into an executable so that you can view the disassembly in IDA. 

Keep in mind that you donâ€™t need to do this step, but converting it into an executable will help you in debugging and understanding the deployed VM evasion techniques which are heavily discussed in Section 5. You can open the decrypted_shellcode.bin in IDA and notice that the disassembly is not parsing functions properly. The malware author has inserted extraneous assembly instructions to through off malware analysis. 0x78 means assembly instruction `js` or `Jump short if sign (SF=1)`.

There are many tools and scripts available that help you convert shellcode into an exe like [shellcode2exe.py](https://github.com/securedorg/shellcode_tools/blob/master/shellcode2exe.py). However I have found that Hexacon provided a nice easy [tutorial for converting shellcode into an executable](http://www.hexacorn.com/blog/2015/12/10/converting-shellcode-to-portable-executable-32-and-64-bit/). This section will be using this YASM and GoLink to create the executable while using CFF explorer to edit the binary header. 

1. Download Yasm
[yasm-1.3.0-win32.exe](http://www.tortall.net/projects/yasm/releases/yasm-1.3.0-win32.exe)
2. Extract **yasm-1.3.0-win32.exe** and rename it to **yasm.exe**
3. Download GoLink linker
[Golink.zip](http://www.godevtool.com/Golink.zip)
4. Extract golink.exe
5. Create a **decrypted_shellcode.asm** file with the following instructions
```
Global Start 
SECTION 'AyyLmao' write, execute,read 
Start:       
incbin "decrypted_shellcode.bin"  
```
6. From a command line run the following command to assemble the code:
```
yasm.exe -f win32 -o decrypted_shellcode.obj decrypted_shellcode.asm
```
7. Now run the linker
```
golink /ni /entry Start decrypted_shellcode.obj
```
8. Open shellcode.exe with CFF explorer and open the **NT Headers->Optional Headers->AddressOfEntryPoint**. Add the current value to 0x42B7 which was the offset of where the malware was going to return to in function `sub_45B794`. AddressOfEntryPoint should be `000052B7`. This will ensure that IDA knows where to start the disassembly.

Finally, open the decrypted_shellcode.exe into IDA for Section 5.
