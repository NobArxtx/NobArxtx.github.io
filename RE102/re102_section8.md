The purpose of this workshop was to get you familiar with Anti Reverse Engineering, Encryption, VM Evasion and Packing techniques. As you saw this malware's packer had multiple layers of shellcode and tricks to throw off a reverse engineer. But by breaking things down step by step, you were able to work your way through each challenge.
